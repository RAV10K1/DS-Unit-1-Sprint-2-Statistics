# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
- I care about basing decision making on data. I am interested in the field of finance as well as business operations.

What do you know about?
- I have a background in banking and the experience and knowledge I have gained over the years have helped me gain
an understanding of business, finance and economics in general.

What decisions do you face?
- The biggest decision I face at the moment is trying to decide a specific topic to use for a data science topic. I have
tentatively decided to model the interaction of an average bank customer over his/her lifespan. I intend to examine the
purchasing behaviour of a set of customers and try to extrapolate the data into real world workable information.
